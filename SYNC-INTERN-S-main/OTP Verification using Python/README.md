**Email OTP Verification**

This Python script facilitates email-based OTP (One-Time Password) verification. It generates a random OTP and sends it to a specified email address for verification. The user is prompted to enter the OTP received via email, and upon successful verification, access to the platform is granted.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Internet connectivity to send emails.

### Setup
1. Ensure you have a Gmail account.
2. Turn on "Less secure app access" for your Gmail account, or generate an App Password if you have 2-step verification enabled.
3. Replace `"example@gmail.com"` in the `sender_email` variable with your Gmail email address.
4. Replace `"your password here"` in the `password` variable with your  generated App Password
   the link "https://myaccount.google.com/u/4/apppasswords"
6. Run the script.

### How it Works
1. The script generates a random OTP (6-digit number).
2. It prompts the user to input their email address where the OTP will be sent.
3. An email with the subject "Email verification code" containing the generated OTP is sent to the specified email address.
4. The user is prompted to input the OTP received via email.
5. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access to the platform is granted.
6. If the OTP verification fails, the user is prompted again for the OTP.

### Security Considerations
- **Password Security**: Ensure that your Gmail account password or App Password is kept secure. Do not share it with others.
- **SSL Certificate Verification**: The script disables SSL certificate verification, which may pose a security risk. Exercise caution and consider enabling SSL certificate verification in a production environment.

### Note
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the email account used for sending OTPs.
- This script is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.

### Dependencies
- `smtplib`: SMTP client session module.
- `random`: Module to generate random numbers.
- `email.message`: Module to represent email messages.
- `ssl`: Module providing access to SSL cryptographic protocols.

### How to Run
1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `email_otp_verification.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing `python email_otp_verification.py`.
